# System Settings

## 0..5 CV option

By default, All CVs are Â±5V, but this is not always a good option, in particular for {guilabel}`TYPE` which controls also the step in a sequence, or {guilabel}`FAM`.

Depending on your module controlling CV, some might not be able to generate negative voltages. In this case you can use the 0..5V instead.

To change the CV range of {guilabel}`TYPE` or {guilabel}`FAM`, press the {guilabel}`TYPE` encoder for 2 seconds, navigate to {guilabel}`SETTINGS`, and then to either {guilabel}`TYPE CV` of {guilabel}`FAM CV`. Click the encoder and change the value to the desired range.


## Screen options

Typically for shooting a video in a controlled light environment, the screen contrast might be too high, and you might not want the screen saver to trigger.

To change the contrast of the screen, navigate to {guilabel}`SETTINGS`, then {guilabel}`SCREEN` and finally {guilabel}`CONTRAST`. Click the encoder and change to value to the desired contrast, from 0 to 15.

To change the screen saver option, navigate to {guilabel}`SETTINGS`, then {guilabel}`SCREEN` and finally {guilabel}`SAVER`. Click the encoder and change to value to the desired value, either {guilabel}`ON` or {guilabel}`OFF`.
