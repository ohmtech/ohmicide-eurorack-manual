# Firmware Update

Thanks to the Daisy platform, upgrading the firmware of your module only requires a USB micro cable and a computer with the **Google Chrome** web browser installed.

Upgrading the firmware brings new features and bug corrections. You don't need to update the firmware if the firmware version already matches the one installed in your module.

To check your firmware version, press the {guilabel}`TYPE` encoder for 2 seconds, turn the encoder fully to the right, and look at the version displayed on the screen.

For complete up-to-date instructions, please refer to the [firmware update page](https://updater.ohmforce.com).

But in general:

1. ⚠️ **Make sure the USB micro cable you are going to use is not only a charging cable** ⚠️. If it looks too thin, or was provided with your bicycle rechargeable front and rear lights, that's most probably not going to make it
2. Turn off your Eurorack system
3. Remove the module from your system
4. Connect the USB cable to your computer and your module. At that stage a LED will light at the center of the Daisy daugther board, and another one will turn on then off at the bottom of the Daisy daugther board
5. Go on the firmware update page that can be found on the Ohmicide product page
6. Press the {guilabel}`FLASH` button at the top of the module (not the Daisy daugther board). At that stage a LED, indicated in the picture below with the **red arrow**, will "breathe" at the bottom of the Daisy daugther board
7. On the programming page on your computer, press "Connect" and select "Daisy Bootloader - Paired"
8. Click "Program" and wait for the process to be finished
9. Disconnect the USB cable, and reinstall the module into your system
10. Turn on your Eurorack system
